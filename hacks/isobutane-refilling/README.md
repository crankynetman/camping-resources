# Overview

I use an isobutane stove (JetBoil MiniMo) to heat water for cooking and, if needed, purification. Isobutane canisters aren't that expensive, but having half-empty 100g canisters lying around drives me crazy. I found a valve that lets me connect two canisters together so that I can refill them. NOTE: I don't recommend doing this yourself, I am only documenting the process for my purposes. Any and all liability here is yours, and yours alone. From a cost standpoint, refuelling is significantly cheaper after you pay-off your up-front costs. From my calculations, if I refill 100g canisters ($5.00 ea.) with 450g canisters ($10.00 ea.) the break even point after investing in the valve and the initial 100g canister is about 15 100g canisters ($75.00). The important thing that I am careful to do, is to weigh the canisters as that is the only way to know how full they are. A 100g canister weighs ~90-100g when empty, so I usually refill to ~200g.
