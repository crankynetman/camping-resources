# Breakfast Omelette

This is a nice and easy breakfast omelette that is very flexible and easy to make. I think it tastes delicious and I am a bit of a breakfast snob.

### Weight (As Listed)

~60-70g, depends on what you put in of course. 

### Water Usage

For hydration I only use ~75-100mL of water. For cooking, I filled my JetBoil MiniMo to about half-full, so ~500ml of water. This water can (and should!) of course be re-used if you have multiple people, so cooking only uses a fixed amount of water regardless of how many omelettes you are cooking.

### Fuel Usage

This uses about one boil. The fuel usage really depends on how many people are coming with you, as you can re-use the water between omelettes if you have multiple people—The water was still pretty warm between omelettes in my JetBoil MiniMo so I am sure I didn't use as much fuel as a full boil.

## Ingredients

The ingredients are very flexible, so I will just list what I personally like. You can really throw anything you want into this just like a normal omelette.

* 4 Tablespoons Ova Easy eggs
* 1 Tsp of dehydrated Jalapeños (I use [Harmony House Dried Jalapeño Dices](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Dried-Jalapeno-Dices-6-oz_p_1732.html))
* 1-2 Tsp of dehydrated Onions (I use [Harmony House Dried Onions](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Dried-Onions-14-oz_p_1746.html))
* 1-2 Tsp of dehydrated Bell Peppers ( I use [Harmony House Dried Peppers, Mixed](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Dried-Peppers-Mixed-10-oz_p_1756.html))
* 1-2 Tbsp of Cheddar Cheese Powder ( I have used popcorn cheese in the past, but next time I am trying [Anthony's Cheddar Cheese Powder](https://www.anthonysgoods.com/products/anthonys-premium-cheddar-cheese-powder-gluten-free-no-artificial-colors?variant=3765643542558), the main difference being that the popcorn cheese usually has a LOT of salt, which resulted in very salty omelettes last time)
* 1-2 Pinches of Salt and Pepper

## Pre-Trip Prep

Mix all of the ingredients into a quart size freezer bag. Freezer bags work best since you will need to boil it while out camping.

## Cooking

Add ~80mL of water to the bag to rehydrate the omelette mix. The water doesn't have to be warm, but it likely helps rehydrate things faster if you already have some spare warm water. If you over-fill the water it's not that big of a deal, your omelette will just be a little soupy—In my experience I am not usually a food critic while on the trail. Once you have added the water, it's nice to let it sit for 5-10 minutes to make sure that your veggies are nice and hydrated. If you're super hungry/hangry, don't worry, you can skip the rehydration period, your veggies might just have a little extra crunch.

Once you have filled the bag, make sure it is nice and tightly sealed in the freezer Ziploc and then bring it to a boil. Once your water has boiled, you should let the bag sit in the hot water with your pot's lid on for approximately 10 minutes or so. You can check on the eggs periodically, but I don't think you can really over-cook them, so it's really just a matter of patience.

When the eggs are done cooking, it will look pretty much like an omelette! It can be a bit hard to tell from the bag, so I have found that squishing the sides of the bag will help you see that the omelette has structure. Once the sides are solidified and can stand on their own in the bag your omelette is ready to eat!

## Modifications

This is a very versatile breakfast meal, you can really use this anywhere that you would use scrambled eggs.

### Breakfast Burritos

I have successfully put my omelette into a tortilla and BOOM, you have yourself a breakfast burrito!

### Other Veggies

Here are some other veggies that would likely be good in these:

* [Dehydrated Spinach Flakes](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Dried-Spinach-Flakes-4-oz_p_1768.html)
* [Dehydrated Tomatoes](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Tomatoes_c_25.html)
* [Diced Dehydrated Potatoes](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Potatoes_c_22.html) could be excellent, especially in a breakfast burrito format
* [Sliced Dehydrated Mushrooms](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Mushrooms_c_18.html) could be excellent as well—I have a container of these I haven't tried yet, but I think it would pair well with Spinach flakes
* [Dried Chives](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Chives_c_71.html) aren't for me, but I know a lot of people like chives for some reason
