# Cheesy Breakfast Omelette with Peppers

This is a nice and easy breakfast omelette that is very flexible and easy to make. I think it tastes delicious even though I am a bit of a breakfast snob.

### Weight (As Listed)

~60-70g, depends on what you put in of course.

### Water Usage

For hydration I only use ~75-100mL of water. For cooking, I filled my JetBoil MiniMo to about half-full, so ~500ml of water. This water can (and should!) of course be re-used if you have multiple people, so cooking only uses a fixed amount of water regardless of how many omelettes you are cooking.

### Fuel Usage

This uses about one boil. The fuel usage really depends on how many people are coming with you, as you can re-use the water between omelettes if you have multiple people—The water was still pretty warm between omelettes in my JetBoil MiniMo so I am sure I didn't use as much fuel as a full boil. A safe budget is ~10g of fuel per-boil.

## Ingredients

The ingredients are very flexible, so I will just list what I personally like. You can really throw anything you want into this just like a normal omelette.

* 4 Tablespoons Ova Easy eggs
* 1 Tsp of dehydrated Jalapeños (I use [Harmony House Dried Jalapeño Dices](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Dried-Jalapeno-Dices-6-oz_p_1732.html))
* 2 Tsp of dehydrated Onions (I use [Harmony House Dried Onions](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Dried-Onions-14-oz_p_1746.html))
* 1 Tsp of dehydrated Bell Peppers ( I use [Harmony House Dried Peppers, Mixed](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Dried-Peppers-Mixed-10-oz_p_1756.html))
* 1 Tbsp of Cheddar Cheese Powder (I have used popcorn cheese in the past, but found it too salty, so now I use [Anthony's Cheddar Cheese Powder](https://www.anthonysgoods.com/products/anthonys-premium-cheddar-cheese-powder-gluten-free-no-artificial-colors?variant=3765643542558). This makes for a pretty cheesy omelette.)
* 1-2 Pinches of Salt and Pepper

## Pre-Trip Prep

Mix all of the ingredients into a quart size freezer bag. Freezer bags work best since you will need to boil it while out camping. Make sure you mix it very well, the cheese has a tendency to clump.

## Cooking

Make sure that you mix up everything very well, the egg crystals like to separate from the rest of the ingredients. Add ~75mL of water to the bag to rehydrate the omelette mix. The water doesn't have to be warm as you are about to throw it into the boiling pot. If you over-fill the water it's not that big of a deal, your omelette will just be a little soupy, but I am not usually a food critic while on the trail. You don't really need to let it hydrate at this point, cooking takes a while, so it will have plenty of time to rehydrate. Once you have filled the bag, make sure it is nice and tightly sealed in the freezer Ziploc. Make sure to mix it up again by squishing the bag, being sure to break up any clumps—The cheese specifically likes to clump up.

Now that everything is mixed and water has been added, place the bag into your pot and then bring it to a boil. Once your water has boiled, you should let the bag sit in the hot water with your pot's lid on for approximately 15-20 minutes—It may even take longer. You can check on the eggs periodically, but I don't think you can really over-cook them, so it's really just a matter of patience. They will be a bit runny no matter what, but if you let them cook long enough, you can get them to firm up quite nicely. If you want to speed things up a bit, you can leave the heat on, keeping the water at a nice slow simmer, however, this will of course use more fuel.

When the eggs are done cooking, it will look pretty much like an omelette! It can be a bit hard to tell from the bag, so I have found that squishing the sides of the bag will help you see that the omelette has structure. Once the sides are solidified and can stand on their own in the bag your omelette is ready to eat!

## Modifications

This is a very versatile breakfast meal, you can really use this anywhere that you would use scrambled eggs.

### Breakfast Burritos

I have successfully put my omelette into a tortilla and BOOM, you have yourself a breakfast burrito!

### Other Veggies

Here are some other veggies that would likely be good in these:

* [Dehydrated Spinach Flakes](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Dried-Spinach-Flakes-4-oz_p_1768.html)
* [Dehydrated Tomatoes](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Tomatoes_c_25.html)
* [Diced Dehydrated Potatoes](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Potatoes_c_22.html) could be excellent, especially in a breakfast burrito format
* [Sliced Dehydrated Mushrooms](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Mushrooms_c_18.html) could be excellent as well—I have a container of these I haven't tried yet, but I think it would pair well with Spinach flakes
* [Dried Chives](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/Chives_c_71.html) aren't for me, but I know a lot of people like chives for some reason
